 ## Introduction

The project is titled as **Book Cricket Game** and developed using C language. Book Cricket is an indoor game which can be played by kids with a book.This game is made for two players. The two players will have to decide who is going to guess the toss. After winning the toss, the player has to select whether he has to bat/bowl first. The player who is going to bat first, need to hold the book. He has to randomly open the pages of the book and look for the last digit of that page number which is nothing but the runs obtained in that particular ball. If the last digit is 7/8/9, then it will be considered as a dot ball. The obtained score will be added to the batsman's score everytime. The batsman will be out if the number is 0. Then, the second player has to play with the book in the same process.

- The two players will have to decide the number of batsman.
- Toss a coin and decide who is going to bat first.
 - The player decided to bat will hold the book with him.
- He has to randomly open the book and look for the page number.
- The player should always look for the side of book which has even numbers on it.
- In the opened page, look for the even number and take note of the last unit in that number. For Example: If the opened page is 154, then the last unit is 4 so the score is 4. So the possible scores are 2, 4, 6, 8 and 0.
2, 4 and 6 score will be added to the batsman score as such and 8 will be a dot ball or counted as a single, it is decided at the beginning of the game when the decide on the number of bats man . 0 score means the batsman is out.

- Close the book and open it again.

- Note the score for that again.

- The total score of the first player is noted and then the second player takes over the Book and continues to play.

At the end who ever has the bigger score is the Winner
